## (2pt) Briefly Answer this question (~half page): What are the pros and cons of TDD? Add a section in README file in your project (i.e., " ECE444-F2023-Lab5") to answer the question.

# Pros:

The pros of test-driven development is that first, since we are writing the tests before we write the actual code, we can detect bugs earlier. Secondly, since we are building on test, we can detect a bug that might occur with ease since on every new update, the developer can test his new code and see what is now working and what stopped working. By doing this, the debugging process speeds up. Furthermore, with the tests, the developer can have some sense of code confidence since the tests can be used to test each component separately. The fourth pros is that the code is maintainable since it follows the SOLID principles that intended to make the design more flexible and maintainable. 

# Cons:

On the other hand the cons, first of all, the developmentâ€™s start is slower than the others since there is an overhead at the beginning where developers write tests before the actual code. Secondly, creating tests before any actual code increases the initial difficulty for a beginner in TDD. Also, if the project is complex, the developer may not capture every possible scenario, and fail to capture it in the tests that might lead to an incorrect/incomplete work, even though the tests that the developer wrote shows it passes every test. Finally, the developer captures every possible test case for the tests, and this can lead into designs that are more complex than what was necessary.
